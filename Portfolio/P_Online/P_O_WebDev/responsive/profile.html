<h2>Company Profile</h2>

	<p>
    	Passive Houses are highly insulated, comfortable, cold bridge free structures that require little heating, they usually have triple glazed windows, heat recovery ventilation (HRV) and high air-tightness levels. It doesn't cost extra to build a Passive House using our construction methods, as money saved on a complex heating system pays for better windows or extra insulation. Combining Passive House principles with Solar heating reduces the heat demand of a Passive House by 90%.

    	Our simple, effective, well thought through, construction methods can give builders throughout Ireland a competitive edge in the market place because it shows they're interested in building more efficient houses.

    	We work closely with, and follow the principles of eminent Dutch Architect and Engineer, Professor Jon Kristinsson who was awarded the "Shell Queens Prize" for energy innovation in Holland and is known there as the "Godfather of Energy". In 1979 Jon built the world's first 183 Passive Houses in Rotterdam, ten years before the first German Passive houses. We've worked previously with Morgan Sindall in the UK, the Quinn Group in the Northern Ireland and Airpacks Ltd as consultants and to upgrade their construction details to provide cold bridge free, condensation free details using standard trades and materials. I delivered a presentation at the 2011 UK Passive House Conference that was well received.

		<dt>"I'm really happy with all the work and the finished product, it looks magnificent all together. The house is fierce warm and it's saving me loads of money. I can go spend it on other things now, and I needn't worry about energy charges! I certainly recommend this service if you need to fine tune your house."
